[jQuery][UI dialog] click catcher
=============

JS Class to catch clicks on defined link and open dialog with page


Usage
------

If your website is in subfolder on server you have to define `path` to `true` to detect path of your site.

To define URLs you want to open in UI dialog you must define an array `links` with links divided to categories. For example:

        catchClick.links = {
        
         add : [
          catchClick.getPath()+'admin/user/add$',
          catchClick.getPath()+'admin/news/add$',
         ],
         
         edit : [
          catchClick.getPath()+'admin/user/edit/[0-9]+',
          catchClick.getPath()+'admin/news/edit/[0-9]+',
         ],
     
         del : [
          catchClick.getPath()+'admin/user/delete/[0-9]+',
          catchClick.getPath()+'admin/news/delete/[0-9]+',
         ]
    
      };

function `getPath()` must be added before URL even if your website is in root path. You can use regexp in URLs for IDs and sth like this. If you don't need to use them at the end you should to write `$` on the end.

Next you must to define button set for each category (it's an object with buttons from UI dialog):

     catchClick.actions = {
    
        add : 
        {
            'Add': function() {
                $('#box_form').submit();
            }
        },
    
        edit :
        { 
            'Edit': function() {
                $('#box_form').submit();
            }
        },
    
        del :
        { 
            'Yes': function() {
                $('#box_form').submit();
            },
            'No': function() {
                catchClick.closeDialog();
            }
        }
    
     }

And finally call `init()` function
